# Igraphics-game-project
It's a game made by IGraphics .Here ,there is a hospital .Some mosquitos with random motion will try to enter the hospital .Our job will be 
to hit the mosquitos .We can fix our mouse location anywhere in the screen and left click on the mouse to shoot .We can also handle the 
speed of our shot and the direction of our shot .The upper in the screen we left click the mouse ,the faster our shot will hit the 
mosquitos .The trajectory of our shooting ball is the same as that of a projectile .Microsoft visual studio and igraphics need to be 
installed to play the game .The installation file for igraphics is given in the repository .
